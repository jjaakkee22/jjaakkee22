2.	I created a GitHub account linked to my student email account (jgpatterson@my.waketech.edu), with the username jjaakkee22, in order to host my profile page.
3.	The repository i created will host my website page and has links to the subpages that I also created.
4.	The steps I took to clone the repository to my PC were fairly simple. I started off by opening GitHub desktop app on my PC, then I proceeded to clone the repository by clicking the clone repository link. Then I chose the repository that I created, then the software for GitHub did the rest.
