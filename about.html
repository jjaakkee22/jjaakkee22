<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m Jasey  Patterson and welcome to my about me. I grew up in a small town in North  Carolina with two siblings. I&rsquo;m a creative person at heart and love finding  new, innovative ways to make things. I enjoy helping people and my goal is to  leave the world a little bit better than I found it. With that core belief at heart,  it helped to shape my views and the talents that I chose to focus on in life. </p>
<p>
  I love helping people solve problems and to just be there  when someone needs me. With that approach on things is what lead me to my  current job at Amazon. I am a learning ambassador in my department. I help new  and current employees learn different types of jobs and roles that they can do  inside the facility. Being in this role has given me so many opportunities to  grow and develop as a person and bring my personal creativity to my workspace.</p> 
<p>
  When I&rsquo;m not at work  helping people, I love to focus my time on my crafts. Since I was a kid, my mom  taught me different things such as sewing, crocheting, cross-stitching, and  many other creative outlets. I also love gardening, which pushed me to build my  own greenhouse with the help of my dad. I enjoy growing a mixture of plants and  vegetables. I often grow more then I need and offer the extras to my family and  friends. I also help them start their own gardens when I can. </p>
<p>
  All of this has led to me currently pursuing an associate  degree in Cybersecurity. It took a couple of trial and errors to help me decide  on an appropriate path that best fit my character. That&rsquo;s when I discovered the  IT programs. With so many different paths to choose from and all the different  things you could do with your degrees, I knew I was making the right choice for  my career&rsquo;s future!</p>
